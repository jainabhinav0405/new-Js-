/**
 * Conditional statements in JavaScript allow the code to make decisions based on certain conditions. The most common types of conditional statements are:

        if
        if...else
        if...else if...else
        switch
        Ternary Operator (? :)


ex-: if (condition1) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if both conditions are false
}   
   
ex:

switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to be executed if expression === value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to be executed if expression === value2
    break;
  default:
    // code to be executed if no case matches
}

ex condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse
